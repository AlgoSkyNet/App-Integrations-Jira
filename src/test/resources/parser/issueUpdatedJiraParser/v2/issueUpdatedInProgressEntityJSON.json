The methodology has been around since the 1980s but was popularised by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. <br/><br/>Scrum breaks the development of a product down in to discrete iterations (termed Sprints) that each deliver functionality that could potentially be shipped to users.<br/><br/>The Scrum Alliance offers an excellent [introduction to Scrum <a href=\"http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/47\">http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/47</a>] that provides an overview of key Scrum concepts, stakeholders, processes and artefacts.",
